# Time Series Demand Forecast: ARMA & Prophet Models

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements advanced time series forecasting techniques to predict demand using multiple models including ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) and Prophet. The analysis is based on the [Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/overview) dataset from Kaggle.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Demand Prediction**: Forecast future demand using historical time series data
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate different forecasting approaches (ARMA, Prophet, Neural Prophet)
- **Feature Engineering**: Create seasonal and trend-based features
- **Performance Analysis**: Compare model accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
